Assingments for CS311: Computer Graphics

We implement a 3D graphics engine in C. We begin with a minimal hardware interface that lets us make a window and set individual pixels to specified colors. Atop this primitive foundation we implement triangle rasterization, texture mapping, scene graphs, projections, lighting, etc.
