Book review by Martin Norris --

This book is a good introduction to OSL in Blender.

The layout is excellent, the author has been very careful to make the
code examples and diagrams {very necessary for showing Blender node
networks} as clear and concise as possible.

The style is also effortless to read. Everything necessary is
explained without information overload, and without skipping any
necessary detail. References lead to more details on different sites.
Including the authors blog which is an excellent Blender resource too.

The content is good. The first chapters deal with programming concepts.
I am a programmer so this was a quick skim read for me; but I think the
examples are sufficient to start even if you know nothing. Then the
main content of the book is on creating shaders in OSL. Each chapter
highlights a feature of OSL and generally creates a procedural texture
type of material.

The book is quite short. Formatted for my 7" tablet it is about
100 pages. There is no contents list or index. I was disappointed
there were no chapters that dealt with the behavior of light,
reflection and refraction etc. Even though there are existing shaders
available for these it would have been very useful to know how to
create shaders that change the light path.
